1) The life cycle of a Data Science project involves several key steps, starting with understanding the problem. This initial phase involves clearly defining the objectives, determining how to measure success,
and identifying the problem type (e.g., classification or regression).

2) Next is gathering relevant data, which includes collecting data from various sources and ensuring its relevance to the problem while 
considering the volume, variety, velocity, and veracity of the data.

3) Following data collection is data preparation and exploratory data analysis (EDA). In this stage, the data is cleaned by handling missing values and removing duplicates, 
and exploratory analysis is performed to gain a deep understanding of the data. Data normalization or scaling may also be necessary at this point.

4)The next step is feature engineering and feature extraction, where new features are created to improve model performance, dimensionality is reduced if the feature space is
too large, and the most important features are selected for modeling.

5)Finally, model building and deployment involve choosing appropriate algorithms, training the models, validating their performance using cross-validation, and deploying the
model for real-time use or batch processing.
