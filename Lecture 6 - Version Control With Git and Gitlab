Introduction to Version Control--

What is Version Control?
Enables you to revert to previous versions of a document if new changes cause errors.
Provides a sophisticated and hassle-free way to manage and manipulate documents.

Why is Version Control Crucial for Software Development?
Allows individuals to work on their own versions independently, avoiding interference from others.

Git: A Popular Version Control System

What is Git?
A distributed version control system where every developer has a complete copy of the project history on their local machines.
Facilitates managing changes independently in respective versions.

Key Features:
Snapshots,Branches,Local and remote repositories

Basic Git Commands:
git init,git add,git commit,git status

What is a Repository?
A storage space or directory for files in a project.
Local Repository: Stored on an individual's system, where they can commit their changes.
Remote Repository: Stored on a server, accessible to others.

What are Branches?
Separate branches allow developers to work on their parts of the project independently from the main branch (master/main).
Commands: git branch to create a branch, git checkout to switch between branches.

What is Push?
git push command uploads changes from the local repository to the remote repository.
Steps: git add -> git commit -> git push

What is a Pull Request?
A request to merge code from a feature branch into the main branch, allowing for discussion, review, and enhancement.

What is a Merge Request?
Similar to a pull request, it involves merging changes from a feature branch to the main branch.
Steps: git push -> Merge (master/main) -> Provide a clear description of changes.

What is Commit?
Saving changes and taking a snapshot of the project, recording the context of these changes.
Steps: git add -> git commit

Basic Git Actions Flowchart
Create Repository -> Clone -> Pull-> Commit -> Push -> Merge

                                Fetch--------------------
Fetch is used to update local repository with changes from remote without merging.

Using Git for Project Management:
*Branch Management,Merging and Conflict Resolution,Version Tracking: Commands like git log, git diff, and git blame.


What is GitHub?
A web-based interface using Git, allowing multiple people to make changes to web pages simultaneously.

Key Features:
*Pull Requests,Forking (copying and modifying repositories),Social networking features for developers

What is GitLab?
A web-based Git repository providing free open and private repositories, issue tracking, and wikis.

Key Features:
*Issue Tracking,CI/CD Pipelines,Merge Requests
